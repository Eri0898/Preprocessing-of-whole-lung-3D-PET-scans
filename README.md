# Preprocessing-of-whole-lung-3D-PET-scans

This repository contains some preprocessing steps that can be applied on radiological scans using Python. Particularly, those steps have been written to work with PET scans, but they can also be applied on other radiological scans, such ad CT scans. 

In the following a brief description of all the steps is reported.
